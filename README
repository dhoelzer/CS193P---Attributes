This project implements the majority of the functionality in the Attributed Strings
demonstration from CS193P.  The Font manipulation is not implemented.

There are differences between this code and the demonstration code from the course.
For example, rather than having stacks of IBActions, we use a single function that
interrogates the sender to determine how to style the text in question.
